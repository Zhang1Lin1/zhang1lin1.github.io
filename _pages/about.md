Zhang Lin has conducted in-depth research in the fields of structural design, fatigue and fracture of complex equipment, and has expanded to the analysis of mechanical properties and key numerical methods of complex equipment. Long term focus on the field of structural integrity design for advanced transport tools.

Adhering to the research concept of "Taoistic Thought Emulates Nature", by studying the service environment of structures, revealing the mechanism of structural failure, improving structural integrity, and achieving green research and development of complex equipment.
